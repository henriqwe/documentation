title: How it Works
---

Given a _schema_/data model, through a textual or graphical modeling language, the **Ycodify** engine will enable your infrastructure with _backend_ and databases so that your application can operate within the SLA levels contracted. This is all you need to quickly instantiate services from our platform for your use.

## Expressiveness in Modeling

The **Ycodify** modeling mechanism will allow its users several perspectives of viewing the objects of their modeling. The models thus generated can be from the lowest level of abstractions, such as diagrams (Entity-Relationship) ER, as well as higher levels of abstraction, such as BPML type diagrams. We also worry about passing through graphical visualization modes of objects/Types to code level. More, you can specify meta-attributes that range from the definition of composite keys at the database level to the sequence of logical tasks.

## Typescript Schema Generation

In addition to the instant enabling of _backend_ services (persistence and access control, for example) from your modeling, the Ycodify mechanism automatically generates components of your application data model in accordance with the standard defined by Typescript and the connectivity layer necessary to it.

## Model Deployment

Once your data model is defined, you can use this specification to deploy your demand for _backend_ service on our platform, update some previous deployment. And that being done through simple commands of the type point-click, or in console integrated to the specification in text mode.

## Usage of the Persistence Service

Through the use of a single _endpoint_ you will be able to perform operations that imply the recovery of data already persisted in our databases (or yours), as well as operations that imply the creation, update or removal of records in such databases.

These operations imply a syntax and semantics of their own that express the desired operation: retrieve data, create, update or remove them. Such operations can be done in batch, or individually. They can also be performed according to ACID (in relational databases) or not (in non-relational databases) restrictions, as well as having in mind the possibility of access control based on the role/user relationship, concurrent read and write control, transactions between distributed databases, etc.

This service also assumes the possibility of our users wanting the execution of business rules in the cloud, whether in our infrastructure, or in third-party infrastructure. The modeling service will be the means through which you can indicate the business rule or the hook for the appropriate location for its execution.

## Object Associations

When you create an association between objects in your models between the Ycodify mechanism will allow you access to the power of expressiveness of SQL type queries, according to the underlying database. That is, operations of the type JOIN are automatically built dispensing the users of the platform the need to understand them, just to these the understanding about the hierarchy of classes/objects of the specified model.

Our modeling tool helps in a simple and intuitive way the construction of queries to the database of the Ycodify platform, offering implementations for these same queries that can be put in the code of _frontend_ applications of our users, whether the queries performed in services of databases of relational or non-relational type.

## Ycodify Cloud

**Ycodify Cloud** allows you to use our services in a highly optimized, managed and scalable way. In addition to including extra reliability, monitoring, caching, tracking, security and deployment resources. You can also request from our platform the commitment to generate a backend according to the JEE/Spring Boot/Cloud standard, in case you want to deploy your own backend independently of our services, unlocking concerns related to _vendor-lock in_ problems.

title: 'Users & Roles'

## Introduction

Users are the people who have access to your project and roles are the permissions that users have in your project. This way, you can control who has access to your project and what they can do.

Here's how you can create users and roles for your project:

## 1. Creating the project

Once you have created a project, you will be presented with a slide containing the project's **Admin username** and **Admin password**, as well as the **X-TenantAC**.

{% callout type="warning" title="Attention!" %}
This is the only time you will be able to copy the _Admin password_. Make sure to save it somewhere safe.
{% /callout %}

After that's done, you can check the warning message and click **Continue**.

## 2. Creating users

Once you're in your project's console page, you can navigate to **Schema** > **Users & Roles** and click **Authorization**.

You will be presented with a slide asking for the project's **Admin password** to get access to the user management page.
